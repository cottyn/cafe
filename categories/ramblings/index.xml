      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meeting new people is rough sometimes, especially for a chronically online introvert shut-in like myself. On the internet there’s so many different people from differing cultures, backgrounds, everything, so sometimes it feels like you can never really know who you’re talking to unless you meet them face to face, and that alone is a huge coin flip. They could be exactly who you thought they were, and they act the same way they do in-person as they did on the internet, or they can be a psychopathic freak who collects pill bug corpses and shit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
