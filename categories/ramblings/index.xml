      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game modding has been a part of video games for decades. From small changes to creating entirely new level designs, it&amp;rsquo;s been a way for players to take their favorite games into their own hands and change them however they&amp;rsquo;d like, whether that be for better or for worse. (&lt;em&gt;Usually worse.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Game modding also holds significant importance across the video gaming industry, and within the gaming community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meeting new people</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meeting new people is rough sometimes, especially for a chronically online introvert shut-in like myself. On the internet, there’s so many different people from differing cultures, backgrounds, everything, so sometimes it feels like you can never really know who you’re talking to unless you meet them face to face, and that alone is a huge coin flip. They could be exactly who you thought they were, and they act the same way they do in person as they did on the internet, or they can be a psychopathic freak who collects pill bug corpses and shit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
