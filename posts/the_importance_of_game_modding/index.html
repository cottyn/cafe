    <p>Game modding has been a part of video games for decades. From small changes to creating entirely new level designs, it&rsquo;s been a way for players to take their favorite games into their own hands and change them however they&rsquo;d like, whether that be for better or for worse. (<em>Usually worse.</em>)</p>
<p>Game modding also holds significant importance across the video gaming industry, and within the gaming community as a whole.</p>
<p>Game mods usually reflect the maker&rsquo;s interest, highlighting a level of devotion that can&rsquo;t be found in many commercial games these days. Making custom content for existing games gives players the opportunity to demonstrate their love for the game and the universe it takes place in. Players come together to create and discuss mods with one another, it&rsquo;s a level of collaboration I personally feel is missing from most modern games these days.</p>
<p>Most games that have been made recently feel incredibly <em>soulless</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like people put time and effort into them, it feels like they wanted to get the shit done as fast as possible to get more cash in their pockets, which I can understand to a certain degree, but when shitstains like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, concord, and Star wars outlaws release, it&rsquo;s hard to feel anything but annoyance.</p>
<p>Tangent aside, that sense of community is the core of video game modding. Mod developers from across the world come together to make something special to them while allowing other players to get the same experience. Modders can learn from each other, share ideas, and build off of one another&rsquo;s works, making something much greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>As creators experiment with different mechanics, they can find where games tend to fall short and might need improving. That feedback loop allows game developers to refine their creations and incorporate player suggestions into the game directly.</p>
<p>For example, the modding scene surrounding Fallout 3 helped Bethesda identify issues with the game&rsquo;s settlement-building system, leading to large updates that improved gameplay as a whole.</p>
<p>Mods play a big part in the lifespan of a game. As a game ages, it slowly becomes less and less supported by the creators, meaning no new content or features will be added for those who still enjoy the games in question. But modders can help in filling that gap, allowing classic titles to remain relevant long after the developers have stopped supporting it.</p>
<p>Supporting a game through modding does more than people might think. To many, it&rsquo;s a lot more than just a hobby, it&rsquo;s their job, and as a whole, it&rsquo;s a vital part of video games. It reflects players&rsquo; drives to keep their favorite games alive one way or another.</p>
